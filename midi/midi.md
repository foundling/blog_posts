## What is MIDI?

MIDI is short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, a communication protocol (a standardized message data format) as well as a hardware and digital interface specification (physical ports and software that converts voltage to digital data) that makes communication possible between MIDI-enabled digital instruments. Common MIDI-enabled devices include keyboards and pianos, guitars, wind instruments, and the more general MIDI-controller, which can vary in form from, say, a 25-key keyboard to a grid of pads akin to what you would find on a sampler. 

In its infancy, MIDI provided a standard way for musicians and composers to connect instruments produced by different manufacturers without having to buy proprietary hardware and software.  

Today, the benefits are even greater. You can do your composing on an airplane with just a small MIDI controller and a laptop.  Or you could play a MIDI flute! And with the drop in the cost of microcontrollers, it wouldn't be very hard to translate weather data read from physical sensors into MIDI data and use it to compose music.

## MIDI in Action

MIDI can communicate all sorts of things, such as pitch, velocity, volume and envelope information. It also communicates clock source information. In the video below, I'm going to demonstrate setting the clock source setting on a digital sampler to act as the master source of tempo and then set the clock-source on a digital keyboard to sync with the sampler.
